{"Title": "Can Mobile Technology Improve Female Entrepreneurship? Evidence from\n  Nepal", "Author": "Bhola Shrestha", "Year": 2022, "Summary": "Gender norms may constrain the ability of women to develop their\nentrepreneurial skills, particularly in rural areas. By bringing\nentrepreneurial training to women rather than requiring extended time away from\nhome, mobile technology could open doors that would otherwise be closed. We\nrandomly selected Nepali women to be trained as veterinary service providers\nknown as community animal health workers. Half of the selected candidates were\nrandomly assigned to a traditional training course requiring 35 consecutive\ndays away from home, and half were assigned to a hybrid distance learning\ncourse requiring two shorter stays plus a table-based curriculum to be\ncompleted at home. Distance learning strongly increases women's ability to\ncomplete training as compared to traditional training. Distance learning has a\nlarger effect than traditional training on boosting the number of livestock\nresponsibilities women carry out at home, while also raising aspirations. Both\ntraining types increase women's control over income. Our results indicate that\nif anything, distance learning produced more effective community animal health\nworkers."}{'Title': 'Can Mobile Technology Improve Female Entrepreneurship?
